CODSOFT DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP TASK-4


In my Sales Prediction project, I used Linear Regression to forecast product sales based on factors like advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and platform selection. After training the model, I plotted a scatter plot comparing the predicted values with the actual sales figures. This visualization helped highlight the accuracy and effectiveness of the model in making reliable predictions.
